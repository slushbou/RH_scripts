rem  Purpose:  For manual backup as an alternative to automatic backup using
rem            "Passport.vbs".
rem  
rem  Use a command like this after attaching an external disk drive to which to back
rem  up RHAM files.  This command assumes the TrueCrypt (TC) vault has already been
rem  mounted on W:.
rem
rem  So the steps for manual backup are:
rem    1.  Attach the external disk drive
rem    2.  Mount the TC volume on W:
rem    3.  In the existing backup folder on W:, change the date in the filename.
rem
rem    4.  (a)  In this script (robo_cmd.txt), change the dates in the filenames as needed --
rem          3 places. (and save this file if it is to be used as a .bat file).
rem
rem        (b)  Set log file destination on host computer.
rem
rem    5.  From X:\Backups_Remote\, run the robocopy command below.  Alternatively,
rem             you could run this file as a batch file if you prefer.
rem        (a)  [TBD] May need to set attributes -H (hidden), -S (system) to backup (archive) folder
rem             if robocopy sets them undesired.
rem        (b)  It will take a few minutes.  While it's running, you can expect to see
rem                Log File: <log file name>
rem   
rem    6.  Verify that the logfile is produced as expected.  Verify no errors.
rem    7.  Dismount the TC vault
rem    8.  Remove/eject from Windows, then detach the external disk drive
